# Facebook Ego Network Analysis

This project visualizes the **ego-Facebook dataset**, which includes anonymized friendship connections. Using Python, NetworkX, Pandas, and Altair (with Vega-Lite), I created two visualizations to better understand the structure and reach of users within the network.

## Visualization 1: Facebook Ego Network Layout

This chart shows a force-directed layout of the Facebook ego network. Each node represents a user, and each edge is a friendship connection. The layout was created with NetworkXâ€™s spring layout algorithm, and nodes are colored by their degree (number of friends), using the viridis color scale. This allows us to see which users are more central or well-connected in the network.

## Visualization 2: Interactive Degree Histogram

This interactive histogram visualizes how many friends each user has. Users can click and drag to select a range of degrees, which filters the bars in real time. This interactivity allows us to explore the distribution more clearly and discover outliers or highly connected individuals.
